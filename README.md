# osmc_nfs-server_plugin

Addon to configure NFS server on OSMC

Instructions:-
  Install Addon from zip.

  Run: Two Options - Install NFS Server or Uninstall NFS Server

Kodi 18 has additional dependances (pip & ipaddress module), this causes a delay to the addon starting while it checks for/installs theses.
